  <p>What's $i^i$? Well, it's a real number, equal to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{e^\pi}}$. But how does one even get this? We can use geometry!</p>
  <p>Complex numbers are numbers of the form $a+bi$, where $i$ is defined to be equal to $\sqrt{-1}$. They can be written $(a,b)$, just like any point in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where $a$ is the <em>real part</em> and $b$ is the <em>imaginary part</em>. This geometric representation of the complex numbers is called the complex plane: the $x$ axis represents the real part and the $y$ axis represents the imaginary part. So the point $(2,0)$ is the real number 2, and the point $(1,1)$ is the number $1+i$.</p>
  <p>Suppose that we have a circle of radius 1 centred at the origin in the complex plane. Then any point on the circle is given by $\cos\theta+i\sin\theta$. This is equal to $e^{i\theta}$. One way to see this is to take the Taylor series
  \[
    \cos{x}=1-\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}-\dots
  \]
  and
  \[
    i\sin{x}=ix-\frac{ix^3}{3!}+\frac{ix^5}{5!}-\dots.
  \]
  Then the series
  \[
    e^{ix}=1+ix-\frac{x^2}{2!}-\frac{ix^3}{3!}+\dots
  \]
  is clearly the sum of the first two.</p>
  <p>Now the number $i$ is the point $(0,1)$, which is at 90 degrees, or $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians, on the circle. Thus $i$ can be written as $e^{i\frac{\pi}{2}}$ (this does admit an <span class="link"><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=e%5E%7B%28e%5E%7B%28e%5E%7B%28e%5E%7B%28e%5E%7Bi*pi%2F2%7D%29*pi%2F2%7D%29*pi%2F2%7D%29*pi%2F2%7D%29*pi%2F2%7D" class="link">infinite recursion</a></span>). Then
  \begin{align*}
    i^i&=\left(e^{i\frac{\pi}{2}}\right)^i\\
    &=e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}}\\
    &=\frac{1}{\sqrt{e^\pi}},
  \end{align*}
  a real number!
